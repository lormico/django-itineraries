# Django Itinerary Planner
Unoriginal name for an unoriginal idea.

[Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com) thought about this who knows how many years ago,
but the implementation isn't 100% perfect IMO.

## Improvement wishlist in respect to Wanderlog
Here's what Wanderlog is missing:

### Lodging (Stays)
* Last datetime to cancel reservation without fees

### Itinerary planning
* Ability to group places, notes, checklists under a **Side Trip** group
  for:
  * clearer planning of the day
  * easily reschedule the Side Trip as a whole

### Map
* Show a label next to the date in the layers filter

### Routing
* Ability to specify waypoints in a computed route
  or to choose between different routes

### Calendar
... it's entirely missing
